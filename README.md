# System-Performance
This system performance monitoring script provides real-time insights into critical server metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space availability,and optional mount points such as external drives. Designed for automation, it runs seamlessly via cron or scheduled tasks and triggers alerts only when thresholds are breached, preventing alert fatigue. The script generates clean, timestamped reports and optionally sends HTML-formatted notifications through an API, ensuring visibility into performance degradation before it impacts operations. Lightweight and customizable, itâ€™s an effective tool for proactive infrastructure health management across Linux environments.
